   The aim with this code, is to give you examples HOW to grab a random arithmetic operator, matching values and perform a 
   reference calculation, so that you can eventually compare what came from the other side. 
   It also shows how to decode a string into different variables. 

   You are free to reuse relevant parts, as the assignment is ABOUT the communication, which is omitted from the example.
